# Mapping
Shows mapping of reference frames in drawing mandelbrot.  
  xbox  pixels
  zbox  complex variables used by mandelbrot equation/series
  
Visually shows relation between selected region in x coords and corresponding region in z coords
This is the heart of zooming into mandelbrot sets.

graphics and the reference frame Transform function are from John Zelle's graphics module

bin0 shows mandelbrot plotted with a very simple binary color function
no images are created in this file

my meta-goal is better programming practices
